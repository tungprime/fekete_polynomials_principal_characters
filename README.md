# Fekete polynomials of principal characters. 

This Github repository contains the codes that we implemented in the paper [1]. 

## Main files.

1. The files "Galois_group_kp" for $$k \in \{3, 5, 7, 11 \}$$ verify our conjecture about the Galois group of $$g_n$$ and $$f_n$$ for $$n$$ of the form $kp$. These files have the same structure. More precisely, in the first part, we verify that the Galois group of
